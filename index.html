                    <p>Jessica Lee Cord was born and currently lives in western North Carolina. After earning degrees in Photography and Global Studies from Appalachian State University, she traveled extensively throughout the United States and lived abroad in India, where she worked with the organization MCCSS assisting previously trafficked and at-risk children. During her time there, she expanded her coding and web development skills and became increasingly invested in how technology can be used to benefit social causes.</p>

                    <p>Returning to the United States, she joined the team at Love146, an anti-child trafficking non-profit, where she currently serves as the organization’s Tech Specialist.Along with managing the organization’s websites and domains, assisting with app development, and handling video production, among many other tasks, Jessica remains committed to learning how to further utilize and adapt sustainable tech systems for social good. </p>

                    <p>When she’s not engaged in efforts to affect social change, she spends time with her rescued greyhound Betty Machete, her tubbo cat Charlie, and her human partner Alan, traveling frequently, kickboxing, and learning new crafts. Together, they squat in a wealthy neighborhood in Charlotte, where they hope to transform their home into a private dog sanctuary, retire at age 30, and eventually move to Amsterdam.
